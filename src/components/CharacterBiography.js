        Without the capacity to control her mutant ability to absorb memories and powers, the young
        woman known as Rogue was once on a dark path. However, Rogue has successfully redeemed
        herself as a heroine and become a leader among the X-Men and the Avengers.

      <p className='biography__description'>
        Anna Marie, the girl who would become Rogue, ran away from home at an early age after
        bristling under the controlling nature of her aunt Carrie. Mystique encountered Anna Marie
        after she had embraced her "Rogue" nickname, and essentially adopted her alongside Destiny,
        Mystique's pre-cognitive mutant lover. Before long, Rogue's mutant powers manifested for the
        first time when she kissed a boy named Cody and left him comatose. Eventually, Rogue
        realized she could never have a normal life and accepted her role in Mystique's Brotherhood
        of Evil Mutants. Rogue fought with Ms. Marvel during one of her early Brotherhood missions,
        and without intending to, she permanently absorbed her foe's memories and powers. Shortly
        thereafter, Rogue and the Brotherhood attacked the Avengers and nearly defeated them. Rogue
        went on to menace heroes such as Dazzler, the X-Men, and one of the Spaceknights, as Carol
        Danvers' ongoing presence in her mind quickly eroded her sanity. With no one else to turn to
        who could help her, Rogue approached the X-Men and their mentor, Professor Charles Xavier.
        Over the objections of his other students (and a very violent objection from Danvers
        herself), Xavier allowed Rogue to join the team. Despite their early misgivings, the X-Men
        came to accept Rogue after she put herself on the line to save Wolverine's fiancée, Mariko
        Yashida, and Colossus. Over time, Rogue became one of the most trusted X-Men, and has gone
        on to both join and lead the Avengers Unity Squad.
